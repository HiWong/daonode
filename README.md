## daonode
Daonode is a porting and rewriting from python to coffeecript(so just javscript) of the dao project. 
What would happen when lisp meets prolog in javascript?  
Dao is the new generation programming system implemented by a functional logic solver, unifying code with data, grammar with program, logic with functional, compiling with running.
